## Music recommender using Spotify API

### _Overview_:
Based on your favorite playlist and choice of song, this recommender system gives you 5 similar songs with high popularity rating.

### _Details_:
 1. This repository consists of _music_recommneder.ipynb_ file, a colab notebook containing the details to retrieve spotify api and build a simple recommendation system. The Clientid and secret key must be obtaiined from your spotify account.
 2. The system is based on the combination of recommending music based on music audio features and weighted popularity. It provides more personalized and relevant recommendations by considering both the content similarity of songs and their weighted popularity.
 3. The database is limited so, the recommendations will be provided only if the input song is in the database. Will be further expanding it using more sophisticated model.
 4. This file gives you raw output in your colab notebook. I will be adding another file to present the output in a webpage using streamlit
